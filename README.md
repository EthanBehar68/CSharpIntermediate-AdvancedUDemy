# CSharpIntermediateUDemy
The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's Intermediate C# course.

I bought and completed this course to my OOP and Classes knowledge and skills. I also learned how to properly leverage interfaces in C#. Previously I had experience with interfaces but never understood how to properly implement them... until now!
