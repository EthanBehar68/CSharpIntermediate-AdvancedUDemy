# CSharpIntermediate/AdvancedUDemy
The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's Intermediate C# course.

I bought and completed this course to reinforce my OOP and Classes knowledge and skills. I also learned how to properly leverage interfaces in C#. Previously I had experience with interfaces but never understood how to properly implement them... until now!

While the work is not present, I went through and completed Mosh Hamedani's Advanced C# course. The reason for not having the work is because he was coding snippets throughout the course. There were no comprehensive exercises to complete like there was with the Intermediate and Beginner courses. Nevertheless I have uploaded my certificate in this project to prove I've completed it.

I bought and completed this course to learn the advance topics of C#. I have dealt with a few of them already. Namely: Delegates, Lambda Expressions, Events, LINQ, and Extension Methods. The other topics I was completely new to but may have had past relevant experience. Namely: Generics, Nullable Types, Dynamic, Exception Handling, Asynchronous Programming with Async/Await.

Certificates located in project folder.
